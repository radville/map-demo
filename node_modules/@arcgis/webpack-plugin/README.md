# Features

This plugin utilizes the [dojo-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin) to build ArcGIS API for JavaScript applications with webpack.

_Requires version `4.7.0` or greater of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-js-api/tree/4master)_

* Uses a lightweight AMD loader _during_ the Webpack build process to resolve module paths. The AMD loader is not used in the output application.
* Creates bundles of your application with ArcGIS API for JavaScript included.

# Usage

`npm install --save-dev @arcgis/webpack-plugin`

In order for the workers used in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to work correctly, you will need to provide an external loader.

This is a temporary solution until we can update how workers are loaded in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript so they are compatible with the output of a webpack build.

```ts
import esriConfig from "esri/config";

const DEFAULT_WORKER_URL = "https://js.arcgis.com/4.12/";
const DEFAULT_LOADER_URL = `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}dojo/dojo-lite.js`;

esriConfig.workers.loaderUrl = DEFAULT_LOADER_URL;
esriConfig.workers.loaderConfig = {
  baseUrl: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}dojo`,
  packages: [
    { name: "esri", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}esri` },
    { name: "dojo", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}dojo` },
    { name: "dojox", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}dojox` },
    { name: "dstore", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}dstore` },
    { name: "moment", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}moment` },
    { name: "@dojo", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}@dojo` },
    {
      name: "cldrjs",
      location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}cldrjs`,
      main: "dist/cldr"
    },
    {
      name: "globalize",
      location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}globalize`,
      main: "dist/globalize"
    },
    {
      name: "maquette",
      location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}maquette`,
      main: "dist/maquette.umd"
    },
    {
      name: "maquette-css-transitions",
      location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}maquette-css-transitions`,
      main: "dist/maquette-css-transitions.umd"
    },
    {
      name: "maquette-jsx",
      location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}maquette-jsx`,
      main: "dist/maquette-jsx.umd"
    },
    { name: "tslib", location: `${DEFAULT_WORKER_URL}tslib`, main: "tslib" }
  ]
};
```

# Options

| Options     |     Default     | Description   |
| ----------- | :-------------: |:-------------|
| `useDefaultAssetLoaders` | `true` | By default, this plugin provides [url-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader) for images and [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader) for fonts and svg that are used by the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. If you are using another library that requires you to also load assets, you may want to disable the default loaders of this plugin and use your own. |
| `root`    | `"."` | Is used in the `env` passed to your loader configuration. See [environment](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin#environment) details in the dojo-webpack-plugin.  |
| `locales` | `undefined`  | The locales you want included in your build output. See the [locales](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin#locales) details of the dojo-webpack-plugin.  |
| `features` | {} | **ADVANCED** - See the [Additional Features](#additional-features) section |
| `userDefinedExcludes` | `[]` | **ADVANCED** - You can provide an array modules as `string` that you want to exclude from the output bundles. For example, you may want to exclude layers you are not using. |
| `options` | `undefined` | **ADVANCED** - You can pass any [native options of the dojo-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin#options) if you want to override some of the defaults of this plugin. This would also allow you to use your own [loaderConfig](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin#loaderconfig) instead of the default one. |

# Best Practices

The bare minimum to start using the plugin is the following:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const ArcGISPlugin = require("@arcgis/webpack-plugin");

// add it to config
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [new ArcGISPlugin()]
  ...
}
```

If you notice some oddities in the path resolutions of modules in your bundles, you can try to define how you want them referenced.

```js
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    // "../app" or similar depending on your build.
    // most likely do not need to change
    root: ".",
    // If you specify locales in the build
    // only those locales are available ar runtime.
    // Leave undefined and all locales will be available at runtime.
    locales: ["en"]
  })
];
```

Maybe you want to override all the default options of this plugin.

```js
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    options: {
      loaderConfig: require("./js/loaderConfig"),
      environment: { appRoot: "release" },
      buildEnvironment: { appRoot: "node_modules" },
      locales: ["en"]
    }
  })
];
```

## Loaders

Whether you are using a TypeScript loader like [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) or writing modern JavaScript and using the [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader), the output files from the loader need to be in AMD. This is so the dependencies can be picked up by the lightweight AMD loader of this plugin during build time.

That means that for TypeScript, your `tsconfig.json` should have the following option:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "amd"
  }
}

```

For babel, update your configuration as follow :

```json
{
  "presets": [["@babel/preset-env",{"modules":"amd"}]]
}
```

## Promises

Webpack will include [ES6 Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) in your bundles, so you may want to include a Promise shim in your application. Some more detail [here](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin#es6-promise-dependency-in-webpack-2x). We have tested the [`@dojo/shim/Promise`](https://github.com/dojo/shim#promises) with success in our test applications. 

See the [dojo-webpack-plugin-sample](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin-sample) for more details.

See [options](#options) section for details of options you can provide to the plugin.

## Node globals

It is recommended that you ignore the node `process` and `global`, so they don't get built into your bundle. You want to set the `fs` module to `empty` so that the webassembly files of the [client-side projection engine](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-projection.html) are loaded correctly.

```js
// webpack.config.js
  node: {
    process: false,
    global: false,
    fs: "empty"
  }
```

## CSS

When working with CSS, you can load the files directly from your application and let the [`html-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) and [`mini-css-extract-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) output the CSS file and inject the file location directly into your output HTML file.
Note: mini-css-extract-plugin requires webpack 4 to work. If you are using webpack 3, you can use the [`extract-text-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin).

```ts
import "./css/main.scss";
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...
      {
        test: /\.html$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "html-loader",
            options: { minimize: false }
          }
        ],
        exclude: /node_modules/
      },
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, "css-loader", "sass-loader"]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    ...
    // will copy your index.html file
    // and inject assets for you
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
      filename: "./index.html",
      chunksSortMode: "none"
    }),
    // will output a css file that you
    // imported in your application
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: "[name].css",
      chunkFilename: "[id].css"
    })
  ]
  ...
```

However, if you would like to use the [`style-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) to load your styles at runtime, you will need to modify your code.

```ts
import "css!./css/main.scss";
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
...
  plugins: [
    ...
    // For plugins registered after the ArcGISPlugin, data.request has been normalized and
    // resolved to an absMid and other mappings and aliases have been applied.
    // You will need to update the loader plugin appropriately.
    new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/^css!/, function(data) {
      data.request = data.request.replace(
        /^css!/,
        "!style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader?indentedSyntax=false"
      );
    })
...
```

Please note, we have tested the `@arcgis/webpack-plugin` with numerous other plugins, but cannot guarantee that other webpack plugins may not cause some unexpected behavior.

## Asset Loaders

By default, this plugin provides provides [url-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader) for images and [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader) for assets that are only used by the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. However, if you are using another library that you need to load image, svg, or fonts for, you will want to provide your own loaders. You will want to set the `useDefaultAssetLoaders` to `false`.

```js
// webpack.config.js
...
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    // disable provided asset loaders
    useDefaultAssetLoaders: false
  })
],
...
```

Then you can provide your own asset loaders.


```js
// webpack.config.js
...
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...
      {
        test: /\.(jpe?g|png|gif|webp)$/,
        loader: "url-loader",
        options: {
          // Inline files smaller than 10 kB (10240 bytes)
          limit: 10 * 1024,
        }
      },
      {
        test: /\.(wsv|ttf|otf|eot|svg|woff(2)?)(\?[a-z0-9]+)?$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "file-loader",
            options: {
              name: "build/[name].[ext]"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
...

```

## Additional Features

### Excluding modules

**NOTE - _Advanced Usage_**

If you are building a 2D mapping application and do not require 3D, you can exclude 3D related modules by disabling the 3d `features`. This option will remove 3D modules from the output JavaScript bundles for your application. Please note, _this does not impact the file size of the JavaScript used in your application, only in the number of bundles generated_.

```js
// webpack.config.js
...
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    // exclude 3D modules from build
    features: {
      "3d": false
    }
  })
],
...
```

You also have the option to pass in an array of other modules that you may want to exclude from your application. For example, maybe you are not using a particular set of layers. You can add them to the `userDefinedExcludes` option.

```js
// webpack.config.js
...
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    // exclude modules you do not need
    userDefinedExcludes: [
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/BingMapsLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/CSVLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/GeoRSSLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/ImageryLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/KMLLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/MapImageLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/OpenStreetMapLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/StreamLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/WMSLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/WMTSLayer",
      "arcgis-js-api/layers/WebTileLayer"
    ]
  })
],
...
```

Again, this considered **ADVANCED** usage, so please use with caution.

### Additional `has` flags

You can provide addition `has` flags to the build as well.


```js
// webpack.config.js
...
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    features: {
      has: {
        // enable native promise in ArcGIS API for JavaScript
        'esri-native-promise': true,
      }
    }
  })
],
...
```

# Sample Applications

Here are some example applications that you can try out for yourself:
- TypeScript: https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/4.x/webpack/demo
- Babel: https://github.com/odoe/jsapi-webpack

# How does it work?

This plugin utilizes the [`dojo-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin) and provides some default settings out-of-the-box.

For the following, you can see the [source code](/index.js) for details of how the plugin is put together.

## Required Files

There are some files that need to be copied over after the bundles are done so they can be referenced dynamically at runtime. We manage this as part of the plugin.

```js
const requiredPlugins = [
  // Copy non-packed resources needed by the app to the build directory
  new CopyWebpackPlugin([
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "dojo/resources/blank.gif",
      to: "dojo/resources"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "@arcgis/webpack-plugin/extras/dojo/",
      to: "dojo/"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "@arcgis/webpack-plugin/extras/dojo/dojo.js",
      to: "dojo/dojo-lite.js"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/core/request/iframe.html",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/core/request/iframe.html"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/views/3d/environment/resources/stars.wsv",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/views/3d/environment/resources/stars.wsv"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/geometry/support/pe-wasm.wasm",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/geometry/support/pe-wasm.wasm"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/themes/base/images/",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/themes/base/images/"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/images/",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/images/"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/workers/",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/workers/"
    },
    {
      context: "node_modules",
      from: "arcgis-js-api/core/workers/",
      to: "arcgis-js-api/core/workers/"
    }
  ]),
  ...
];
```

## Feature Detection

This plugin also utilizes the [webpack-hasjs-plugin](https://github.com/chuckdumont/webpack-hasjs-plugin) to set compile time static features that help enable the removal of unused code.

```js
const requiredPlugins = [
  ...
  // Check for has() features in the build
  // Feature list taken directly from what is
  // used in Dojo builds
  new HasJsPlugin({
    features: {
      "some-static-feature": false
    }
  }),
  ...
];
```

There are cases in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript where feature detection is used.

```js
if (has("some-static-feature")) {
  return true;
}
else {
  return false;
}
```

This will be converted to the following.

```js
if (false) {
  return true;
}
else {
  return false;
}
```

So when the code is run through the build and minification becomes only `return false`.

Please refer to the webpack-hasjs-plugin for [known limitations](https://github.com/chuckdumont/webpack-hasjs-plugin#limitations).

## Override loader plugins

We are also able to change a couple of references to loader plugins and replace the output with defined modules. We manage that as part of the plugin as well.

```js

const requiredPlugins = [
  ...
  // For plugins registered after the DojoAMDPlugin, data.request has been normalized and
  // resolved to an absMid and loader-config maps and aliases have been applied
  new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(
    /^dojox\/gfx\/renderer!/,
    "dojox/gfx/svg"
  ),
  new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/\/moment!/, "moment/moment")
];
```

## Other loaders

We have some additional loaders we add out-of-the-box that are utilized as part of the Webpack bundling of CSS files and other assets.

```js
const additionalLoaders = [
  // @dojo modules are referenced in the API and need to be loaded via a umd loader
  {
    test: /@dojo/,
    use: "umd-compat-loader"
  },
  {
    // scoped to the arcgis-js-api resources only
    test: /arcgis-js-api\/.*(jpe?g|png|gif|webp)$/,
    loader: "url-loader",
    options: {
      // Inline files smaller than 10 kB (10240 bytes)
      limit: 10 * 1024,
    }
  },
  {
    // scoped to the arcgis-js-api resources only
    test: /arcgis-js-api\/.*(wsv|ttf|otf|eot|svg|woff(2)?)(\?[a-z0-9]+)?$/,
    use: [
      {
        loader: "file-loader",
        options: {
          name: "build/[name].[ext]"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

Then we instantiate the dojo-webpack-plugin with the options provided and pass that into the Webpack pipeline.

```js
this.options = {
  globalContext: path.join(__dirname, "node_modules", "arcgis-js-api"),
  environment: {
    root: options.root || "."
  },
  buildEnvironment: {
    root: "node_modules"
  }
};
this.options = { ...this.options, ...options.options };
if (!this.options.loaderConfig) {
  this.options.loaderConfig = require("./lib/loaderConfig");
}

this.dojoPlugin = new DojoWebpackPlugin(this.options);
```

## Loader Configuration

We also provide a default [loaderConfig](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin#the-dojo-loader-config) for this plugin that defines the [location of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and its dependencies](/lib/loaderConfig.js). Note, this should only be used for dependencies of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, you do not need to define locations for other libraries used with your application.

We provide some default `has` configurations of the loader.

```js
    ...
    has: {
      "dojo-config-api": 0,             // Don't need the config API code in the embedded Dojo loader
      "esri-promise-compatibility": 1,  // Use native Promises by default
      "esri-webpack": 1,                // a flag used internally by the ArcGIS API for JavaScript
      "esri-featurelayer-webgl": 1      // Enable FeatureLayer WebGL capabilities
    }
    ...
```

# Things we're working on

1.  Compatibility with [`DllPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/). We're trying to find how we can create a single Dll or multiple Dll files to share across multiple applications.
2.  Improved bundles. We're going to be working towards trying to reduce the number of bundles that Webpack generates due to how we dynamically import modules at runtime.
